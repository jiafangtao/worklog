## Why another wheel?
This is a personal project aiming to log my daily work with GTD (Get Things Done) methodology.
Similiar tools like trello.com, kanbanflow.com are widely avaiable with free tier offerings.
So why to invent another wheel? Although those services offer rich functionalities, most of them
are overkill to me. What I need is a pure native web application with some basic features including
task management, logs, stop watch/pomodora watch, statistics and reports. That's it!

## How to build, test and run


### Tech Stack
- worklog app uses React as the front-end framework
- The data is stored in `local storage` of the page
